## Algorithm Exercises

This repository is a copy of the code that I wrote to solve Freecodecamp exercises.   The code was originally written in the Freecodecamp sandbox and is still hanging out there with date stamps of when I orginally solved them (c. 2016).  You can access them [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/gramparallelo "Link").
